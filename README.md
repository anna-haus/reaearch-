# reaearch-

With so much information availale online nowadays it takes a lot of time and research to make an educated desicion about pretty much anything. Sure Google and other search engines offer you pleanty of options to narrow the search, but it still takes time and effort. 

I'd love to make a tool that is helping people save time on research. Example: When I moved to Zurich and started looking for ways to pass time with my 1 year old, It was very difficult to find anything, becuase the infomration was sipmly too scattered, plus it was in various languages one of which i didn't really understand back then. So it took me a very long time to study local facebook groups (and to find them first), all internet searches in local language (with google translate), and looking around for advertisemnts offline that also excited online but did not show up on search due to lack of good SEO.
