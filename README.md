# reaearch-

With so much information availale online nowadays it takes a lot of time and research to make an educated desicion about pretty much anything. Sure Google and other search engines offer you pleanty of options to narrow the search, but it still takes time and effort. 

Imagine you wouldn't have to spend time anymore googling and reading through all articles/blog posts, etc to find out which steam cooked to buy, or what are the available kids activities in the city you are planning to move to.
